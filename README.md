<h1>Skate Tricks App</h1>

This is an app created to help with learning info about different skateboarding tricks. The user types in a skate trick and a description of the trick and a gif is given to the view. This app consumes data from an API that I created for this project. It is currently hosted by Railway.

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

Front End tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

I learned how to host an API using heroku and railway. I learned that when certain services arent offered anymore its time to sit down and research alterative solutions to my problems. I learned how to handle gifs and video clips and implement them into my application and database.
